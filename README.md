# Critique By Design

My interest is in drug policy reform and one of the biggest challenges in this field is reshape the narrative around drug usage. I was interested in this data visualization because how you present data and what you choose to highlight has as a big an impact on the user take-away as the data itself. The original data visualization was from [The National Institute on Drug Abuse][ref-id-original]

 ## Goals
 To improve on this data visualization I followed Few's "Data Effectiveness Profile" model, that is, I assessed the aesthetic effectiveness and the informational effectiveness.
 
 Aesthetically I felt the biggest problems were the color (colors were too dramatic, eliciting incorrect emotions and categories, too much contrast), the title (was not descriptive), and chart type (poor axis choices, bad chart type to show time-dependent changes).
 
 Informationally, I felt like the data visualization failed to highlight the most salient points (which I felt was that illicit drug use was actually falling, despite the dramatic increase in vaping), and that alcohol was a bigger problem than marijuana.
 
 ## Wireframe
My wireframe proposal is shown ![here](https://imgur.com/xGabIbn)

My original idea was to have a graph that showed vaping usage (the most dramatic NIDA claim) but in comparison to alcohol usage - with a horizontal line drawn across the top of the alcohol bars. This would visually show that, though dramatic in its rise in usage, vaping was a less dangerous drug than something we passively accept, alcohol. I also note some aesthetic changes, like color changes, and title changes that would improve the messaging.

My second graph's message was to show that marijuana usage was holding relatively steady, in comparison to all other illicit drugs, in the past two decades. I was hoping to do that by putting a data-callout on the high points and at the 2018 mark to show how much marijuana usage has actually fallen since it's peak in the late 90's.

My overall goal change the narrative, by emphasizing the relatively high levels of alcohol use (abuse) which we implicitly accept, and demonstrating the relatively benign nature of marijuana and vaping.

(I showed my wireframe to a friend, along with the original webpage - my wireframe could not stand on its own - but I did not get much helpful feedback from them, just that those changes would indeed improve my messaging).

## Infographic
When creating my infographic I couldn't create the image exactly as I had planned, but I wanted to still improve on the deficiencies I saw in the original site. The first deficiency was that the most prominent message, a significant increase in vaping across all grade levels and types, was not showcased in a visualization that showed what that percentage growth was. The data only included the change from 2017 to 2018, so a line graph would not work. I decided on a stacked bar chart that showed 2017 as the bottom bar, and 2018 as the increase.

I also added bold and larger fonts in the text to highlight the most important take-aways, in this case, the increase in vaping in the last year.

I think wanted to balance that critical narrative with a more positive overall narrative that drug use is NOT sky-rocketing, and that in fact illicit drug use was in the decline. I decided to use a line graph with the y-axis range reduced to emphasize the range we cared about and to emphasize the reduction in usage (I did not feel like this subjective choice was misleading the user).

Originally in my wireframing my goal was to convince the reader that marijuana usage is not a significant problem. I was hoping to achieve that with comparative line charts, but when I started my design I felt a direct factual comparison would be more compelling. That is I could highligh the increase in marijuana usage was far outpaced by the reduction in alcohol usage, and thus the narrative I am supporting (though not explicitly) was that marijuana use was serving as a much healthier and less dangerous complement to alcohol - a trade that I am willing to make.
