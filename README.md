# Critique By Design

My interest is in drug policy reform and one of the biggest challenges in this field is reshape the narrative around drug usage. I was interested in this data visualization because how you present data and what you choose to highlight has as a big an impact on the user take-away as the data itself. The original data visualization was from [The National Institute on Drug Abuse] (https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/monitoring-future-survey-high-school-youth-trends)

 ## Goals
 To improve on this data visualization I followed Few's "Data Effectiveness Profile" model, that is, I assessed the aesthetic effectiveness and the informational effectiveness.
 
 Aesthetically I felt the biggest problems were the color (colors were too dramatic, eliciting incorrect emotions and categories, too much contrast), the title (was not descriptive), and chart type (poor axis choices, bad chart type to show time-dependent changes).
 
 Informationally, I felt like the data visualization failed to highlight the most salient points (which I felt was that illicit drug use was actually falling, despite the dramatic increase in vaping), and that alcohol was a bigger problem than marijuana.
