# Critique By Design

My interest is in drug policy reform and one of the biggest challenges in this field is reshape the narrative around drug usage. I was interested in this data visualization because how you present data and what you choose to highlight has as a big an impact on the user take-away as the data itself. The original data visualization was from [The National Institute on Drug Abuse] (https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/monitoring-future-survey-high-school-youth-trends.html)
